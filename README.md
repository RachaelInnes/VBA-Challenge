VBA Challenge
It should be noted that for this challenge I did refer to multiple sources to assist me with the coding. You will note in the script code that I had to run some debugging scripts as I needed assistance particularly with errors in the total volumes. I have left these in the code.
I referred to multiple sources, generally Stack Overflow with specific questions (such as how to set variables correctly as long etc.)
I also utilised Chat GPT to cut and paste code there to validate this when there was an error, and formatting.


VBA CHALLENGE RESUBMISSION
Thankyou for your feedback on my assignment. I have now restarted this and retested each part of my code. I have done this by indidivual subs for most of the functions. when I tested it. I did use AI to assist me with errors, these were namely due to - error in naming variables, and ensuring % was included. 
Please note: I have called each of the documents for anything I have redone by naming these as "Resubmission" - this is what I have used in the Screenshot and also in the VBA script.
