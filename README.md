VBA Challenge
It should be noted that for this challenge I did refer to multiple sources to assist me with the coding. You will note in the script code that I had to run some debugging scripts as I needed assistance particularly with errors in the total volumes. I have left these in the code.
I referred to multiple sources, generally Stack Overflow with specific questions (such as how to set variables correctly as long etc.)
I also utilised Chat GPT to cut and paste code there to validate this when there was an error, and formatting.
